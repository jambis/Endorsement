# Artifacts

Artifacts would be your LinkedIn profile, Portfolio along with the projects to showcase (At least 3 projects), Resume, and your Github profile.

## Github

- Refer to the [rubric](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1geqZSdwle2YU6dRGjBbvFT2U9WqReOLU/view) make sure you aim for those 3 stars in each section that applies to you
- One thing I recommend doing early on is making a private repo for your code challenges, Normally around the time you start Computer Science (CS) you should practice doing a lot of code challenges.
  - Make sure to commit and push on days where you didn't code, the trick here is to keep your github contribution graph with as many green squares as possible
  - Try doing coding challenges in 3 languages (Python, JS, and other language of your choice)
- Everytime you complete a build week project make sure you update the `Readme.md`, with as many details as possible, so later on you remember exactly what you did, and when applying to jobs developers can look at your `Readme.md` and get a quick look at what you accomplished. The following are things I added to the `Readme.md`
  - Title of the Project - quick explanation what the app intends to solve, technical design document, figma design (if available), Trello Board, Deployed link, disclaimer of the length the project was done in.
  - Motivation - Motivation for making this app
  - Features - Feature that were implmented
  - Getting Started - Instructions how someone could have the code up and running on his end
  - Technologies that were used in the project
  - Authors/Contributors
- Make sure you pin projects you want people to immediately see when they land on your profile, you can do this by clicking `Customize your pins` on your profile.

## LinkedIn

- [Rubric](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15iB86TUKAMUaHxB3zf74A5oRTwmAVnkL/view) for LinkedIn
- Most things are self explanatory, if you did a good job during build weeks and labs of updating readme, all of this should come to you a lot easier, I personally did my resume and portfolio before working on this, and then its copy and paste. But you can definitely do it the other way around.
- Not much advice here it's pretty self explanatory from the rubric

## Portfolio

- [Rubric](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15iB86TUKAMUaHxB3zf74A5oRTwmAVnkL/view) for Portfolio
- I had a lot of fun remaking this whole website in React, personally I didn't want to use the HTML5 up template page that was done during the curriculum. By the point you reach CS or Endorsement unit, you would've learned so much, and something about being a web developer but using template pages doesn't sit well wiht me.
- I purchased a domain with **Google Domains** and hosting is done with **Netlify**. Click [here](./Googledomains.md) in how to setup the DNS servers
- An advice I have heard given a lot is that recruiters don't have that much time to go through everything on your portfolio or your resume for that matter. So make sure the core of your project doesn't take that many clicks or scrolling to get to. Most importantly make sure your projects and contact links are quickly accessible upon landing on the frontpage.

## Resume

- [Rubric](https://drive.google.com/file/d/103wsR5GxmLhQYEjIcBMA3hFc0Ge1artc/view) for resume
- [Deep dive into Resumes](https://lambdaschool.com/the-commons/how-to-write-a-stand-out-resume) by Lambda School
- [Another deep dive in resumes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BOwmlkiPJH_96dnjI3nAW8ok-BOR8hkl5Us70bwf24U/edit) by Lambda School
- Some neat templates [1](https://resumegenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/data-scientist-resume-example-template.png), [2](https://resumegenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Software-Engineer-Resume-Example-Template.png), [3](https://assets.qwikresume.com/resume-samples/pdf/screenshots/mobile-developer-1530594976-pdf.jpg)
- Personally I prefer the one column approach over splitting the whole resume into documents, but I guess either works.
- Power statements covered in the deep dives are key and be descriptive about your role, mentioned awards if a project won something. Maybe your labs project was 1 of the 5 selected to present for Shark tank.
- One thing you **never** want to do is rate yourself on your skills.
