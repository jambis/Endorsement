# Technical Interview

Technical interview is a 2 part process. First you will take a HR coding challenge that usually consists of 4 problems (There's also another test set that has 3 problems and give you slightly less time, but I'm not familiar how the points are distributed), giving you a total of 4 hours to complete the HR challenge. You can go back and forth on problems if you get stuck on a particular problem and want to move to another problem to take some time to think about a previous one.

Problem 1 is usually 50pts, problem 2 75pts, problem 3 50pts, problem 4 75pts.
You **don't** need to pass all the tests of a problem to grab pts, in other words there is partial credit. It is important that you're able to talk about your solution and can identify why you're coming short on a solution that would pass all the tests. You only need to 60% to be able to schedule the interview. A note to add is that not all tests are displayed in the Hacker Rank, while it may display only 15 tests, there could be 45 tests that get submitted for just one problem.

Before submitting your HR test, make sure you copy your code over to a file so that you can study them later for the interview. Put them in your private code challenge repo (hopefully you made one). In this second part of the interview, you will dive into questions of Big O notation, what is the runtime of each line of code and then whats the total runtime. In what ways could the algorithm be improved?

## Tips

- It goes without saying, you have to practice code challenges to be able to get past the hacker rank challenges. Problems in the test aren't that difficult, they usually involve using some technique such as using hash maps, looping through arrays, prefix sums, two pointers, using stacks, queues or linked lists.
- Copy over the problems from Hacker Rank into your code-challenge repo you should've created, so that you can familiarize yourself with the code in preparation of the interview, brush up on Big O.

- Some code challenges sites, try to be able to get through the easy problems, ideally for job interviews if you can pass some mediums in each category you should be good.
