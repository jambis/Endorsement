# Technical Interview

Technical interview is a 2 part process. First you will take a HR coding challenge that usually consists of 4 problems, giving you a total of 4 hours to complete the HR challenge. You can go back and forth on problems if you get stuck on a particular problem and want to move to another problem to take some time to think about a previous one.

Problem 1 is usually 50pts, problem 2 75pts, problem 3 50pts, problem 4 75pts.
You don't need to pass all the tests of a problem to grab pts, in order words there is partial credit. I think as long as you're able to talk about your solution and can identify why you're coming short on a solution that passes all the tests you would be fine during the interview (second part of the process). You need only a 60% to be able to schedule the interview.

Before completing first process, make sure you copy your HR challenges code somewhere so that you can study them and have a reference. Put them in your private code challenge repo (hopefully you made one). In this second part of the interview, you will dive into questions of Big O notation, what is the runtime of each line of code and then whats the total runtime. In what ways could the algorithm be improved?
