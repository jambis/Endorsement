# Web Core Interview

The interview will be conducted by either an instructor, or an engineer. I happened to get interviewed by an engineer, former Lambda School student. It is recommended that you use your projects from build week 3 and build week 4, but you can use at little or as many projects you like as long as you can answer the questions.

## Questions

### Frontend

- Where have you implmented global state management, why did you implement it?
- What steps did you take to implement redux in your project?
- What is accessibility and why is it important?
- You demonstrate to me in your web app where you communicated with an external API. How did you do it?
- Can you show me mobile design in your app and tell me what steps you took to get your app be mobile responsive.
- Show me how you implemented routes in your web app.
- Questions about forms and having validation on them.
- What another syntax to handle promises (async/await) ?
- Show me where you have used higher order function in your app (and yes array methods such as map, reduce, filter, forEach are higher order functions, even hooks for that matter).
- Talk about the different HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)

### Backend

- Talk to me about the tables you implemented and the relationship between them.
- Show me where you had to use join statements for a table.
- How did you handle routes in your backend and why did you set them up that way? What routes are restricted?

## Tips

- Make sure you have your projects on your machine, and be ready to share screen and have the projects open that you would want to use to cover the questions.
- Get really comfortable with your code, and know where things are.
- Interview is pretty straight forward, for me it wasn't too much on theory but more on how you applied the concepts in your project. However I have heard this changes depending on who you are interviewed by. So only recomendation is to use whatever resources you have found and the ones provided below.
- Some questions can be very open ended and sometimes leave you confused on what exactly they're expecting as an answer. I would just try to address the question the best I can and always ask at the end if there was something more they were looking for in your answer. The intent is to get them to provide feedback of your answer and not just assume that you don't know the answer and take points off.
