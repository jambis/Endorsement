# Endorsement

In this repo you will find the endorsement process for lambda school at the time when I was going throught the endorsement unit in **April 2020**, of course this process is subject to change but I believe some of the tips and resources that I've used during the process will remain relevant.

## Table of Contents

1. [Artifacts](./Artifacts/index.md)
2. [Behavioral Interview](./Behaviortal_Interview/index.md)
3. [Technical Interview](./Technical_Interview/index.md)
4. [Web Core Interview](./Webcore_Interview/index.md)

## General Breakdown

Here is what is needed to become Lambda endorsed.

1. Have your Linked, portfolio, github and resume checked off by a career coach.
2. Pass the 30 minute behavioral interview.
3. Two part process, pass a hacker rank challenge that consist of 4 problems (4 hrs) and a 1 hour interview to do a more deep dive over your hackerrank challenge answers.
4. Pass a 1 hour web track interview (backend & frontend)
