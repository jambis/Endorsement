# Endorsement

In this repo you will find the endorsement process for Lambda School at the time when I was going through the endorsement unit in **April 2020**. This is only for the Web curriculum, of course this process is subject to change but I believe some of the tips and resources that I've used during the process will remain relevant.

## General Breakdown

Here is what is needed to become endorsed at Lambda School.

1. Have your Linked, portfolio, github and resume checked off by a career coach.
2. Pass the 30 minute behavioral interview.
3. Two part process, pass a Hacker Rank (HR) code challenge and a 30 minute interview to do a more deep dive over your HR challenge answers.
4. Pass an 1 hour Web track interview (backend & frontend)
